## Project Overview

### Goal
Distribute the existing, working Mermaid Slides tool through three channels:
1. **🌐 Web Deployment** - Public website for quick exploration

3. **🔧 VS Code Extension** - Integrated markdown preview

### Current Status
- ✅ **Foundation**: Modern TypeScript React app with complete architecture
- ✅ **Features**: File upload, diagram parsing, presentation mode, theming
- ✅ **Testing**: 47 passing tests with comprehensive coverage
- ✅ **Web Deployment**: Live at GitHub Pages with CI/CD
- ✅ **Offline Package**: Complete self-contained distribution

- [x] Rebuild offline package with relative paths

#### In Progress Tasks
- [ ] Investigate Docker container networking issues
- [ ] Design multi-channel architecture strategy
- [ ] Performance benchmarking (offline vs web)
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility validation

#### Strategic Questions
- [ ] Single-repo vs multi-repo for 3 distribution channels
- [ ] Branch strategy for development and releases
- [ ] Version synchronization across channels
- [ ] Security audit workflow implementation
- [ ] Docker containerization benefits analysis

### Phase 4: VS Code Extension 📋 **PLANNED**
**Objective**: Third distribution channel - IDE integration

#### Pending Tasks
- [ ] Create VS Code extension project structure
- [ ] Set up extension manifest and configuration
- [ ] Embed Mermaid Slides as webview
- [ ] Implement "Preview Mermaid Slides" command
- [ ] Add right-click context menu for .md files
- [ ] Auto-detect mermaid diagrams in markdown
- [ ] Test extension thoroughly
- [ ] Publish to VS Code Marketplace

## Technical Implementation Details

### Web Deployment
- **Platform**: GitHub Pages with automated deployment
- **Pipeline**: Tests → Build → Deploy on master branch
- **Features**: Mobile-responsive, feature showcase, help sections
- **Performance**: <30 seconds from visit to first presentation

### Offline Package
- **Dependencies**: All bundled locally, zero external calls
- **Servers**: Python, Node.js, Windows batch, Unix shell scripts  
- **Setup**: <5 minutes from download to running locally
- **Compatibility**: Windows, macOS, Linux
- **Status**: ✅ Python server tested and working, Docker networking under investigation
- **Testing**: Verified at http://localhost:3005 with all assets loading correctly

### VS Code Extension (Planned)
- **Integration**: Webview for embedded React app
- **Features**: Right-click preview, auto-detection, live updates
- **Target**: <1 minute from install to first preview

---

## Success Metrics

### Distribution Goals
- [x] **Web**: Live and accessible public URL
- [x] **Offline**: Downloadable, self-contained package
- [ ] **VS Code**: Published extension with >100 installs

### Quality Metrics
- [x] Core functionality works in web and offline channels
- [x] Complete workflow (file → presentation) in both channels
- [x] Clear documentation for setup and usage
- [ ] No critical bugs in first week after all channels launch

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Build Issues**: Test builds early and often ✅
- **Dependency Problems**: Verify offline mode compatibility ✅
- **Extension Complexity**: Start simple, iterate 📋

### Distribution Risks
- **Platform Changes**: Multiple hosting options available ✅
- **Marketplace Rejection**: Follow guidelines, have fallbacks 📋
- **User Adoption**: Clear documentation and examples ✅

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Test First**: Ensure current functionality is solid ✅
2. **Simple Deployments**: Use standard deployment methods ✅
3. **Incremental**: Complete one channel before starting next ✅
4. **Documentation**: Clear setup instructions for each channel ✅

### Resource Requirements
- **Time**: 8-12 days total (3 channels complete, extension pending)
- **Skills**: React deployment ✅, VS Code extension development 📋
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub account ✅, hosting platforms ✅

## Deferred Features

The following features are **NOT** included in the current distribution plan:
- Performance optimization beyond current acceptable levels
- Advanced accessibility features
- Progressive Web App features
- Analytics and monitoring
- Advanced error handling beyond current implementation

**Rationale**: Focus on delivering working tool to users first, add enhancements based on feedback.

**Next Milestone**: Complete Phase 3.5 - Quality Assurance & Distribution Strategy  
**Current Priority**: Investigate Docker container networking issues and complete architecture strategy

**Recent Progress** (2025-07-03):
- ✅ Fixed offline package asset path issues 
- ✅ Created comprehensive versioning and dependency management strategies
- ✅ Verified offline package works correctly with Python server
- 🔄 Docker container networking investigation needed
