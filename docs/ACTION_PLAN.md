## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Build Issues**: Test builds early and often ‚úÖ
- **Dependency Problems**: Verify offline mode compatibility ‚úÖ
- **Extension Complexity**: Start simple, iterate üìã

### Distribution Risks
- **Platform Changes**: Multiple hosting options available ‚úÖ
- **Marketplace Rejection**: Follow guidelines, have fallbacks üìã
- **User Adoption**: Clear documentation and examples ‚úÖ

---

## Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **Test First**: Ensure current functionality is solid ‚úÖ
2. **Simple Deployments**: Use standard deployment methods ‚úÖ
3. **Incremental**: Complete one channel before starting next ‚úÖ
4. **Documentation**: Clear setup instructions for each channel ‚úÖ

### Resource Requirements
- **Time**: 8-12 days total (3 channels complete, extension pending)
- **Skills**: React deployment ‚úÖ, VS Code extension development üìã
- **Infrastructure**: GitHub account ‚úÖ, hosting platforms ‚úÖ

---

## Deferred Features

The following features are **NOT** included in the current distribution plan:
- Performance optimization beyond current acceptable levels
- Advanced accessibility features
- Progressive Web App features
- Analytics and monitoring
- Advanced error handling beyond current implementation

**Rationale**: Focus on delivering working tool to users first, add enhancements based on feedback.
