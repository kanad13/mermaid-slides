## 🎯 Distribution Channel Synchronization

### 📦 Current Channels
1. **Web Deployment** (GitHub Pages)
2. **Offline Package** (Downloadable ZIP)
3. **VS Code Extension** (Planned)

### 🔄 Version Synchronization Strategy

**Approach**: **Unified Versioning**
- All channels maintain the same version number
- Releases are coordinated across all channels
- Each channel includes version identifier

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simple for users to understand
- ✅ Clear compatibility between channels
- ✅ Easier support and debugging

### 📅 Release Coordination

**Process:**
1. **Development** → All changes made in main repository
2. **Testing** → All channels tested simultaneously  
3. **Release** → Version tag created in git
4. **Deploy** → All channels updated with same version

---

## 🏷️ Version Tagging Strategy

### 📋 Git Tag Format
```bash
# Release tags
v1.0.0          # Full release
v1.1.0-beta.1   # Beta release
v1.1.0-alpha.2  # Alpha release
```

### 🚀 Release Types

**Stable Releases**: `v1.0.0`
- Fully tested across all channels
- Production-ready
- Full documentation
- No known critical bugs

**Beta Releases**: `v1.1.0-beta.1`
- Feature-complete but may have minor bugs
- Available for user testing
- Documentation may be incomplete

**Alpha Releases**: `v1.1.0-alpha.1`
- Early development versions
- For developer testing only
- May have incomplete features
