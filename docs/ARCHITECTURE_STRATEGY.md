**Phase**: 3.5+ - Automated Multi-Channel Deployment  
**Status**: Strategic Framework Document  

---

## Executive Summary

This document defines the architecture strategy for distributing Mermaid Slides across two active channels: Web and Offline. The VS Code Extension channel has been removed to eliminate feature drift and will be redesigned from scratch in a future phase. The strategy ensures maintainability, consistency, and scalability while minimizing complexity.

## Recommended Architecture: Single Repository with Channel-Specific Builds

### Decision: Single Repository (Current Approach) âœ…

**Rationale**:
- Core React application remains identical across all channels
- Shared component library, hooks, and utilities
- Unified testing suite covers all distribution channels
- Single source of truth for bug fixes and feature updates
- Simplified dependency management and security updates

### Repository Structure Strategy

```
mermaid-slides/                    # Main repository
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                          # Core React application (shared)
â”œâ”€â”€ public/                       # Web-specific assets
â”œâ”€â”€ offline-package/              # Offline distribution build
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/                      # Build and deployment scripts
â”œâ”€â”€ docs/                         # Documentation
â”œâ”€â”€ config/                       # Build configurations
â””â”€â”€ dist/                         # Generated builds
```

### Channel-Specific Adaptations

#### 1. Web Channel (âœ… Complete)
- **Build Target**: Static files for GitHub Pages
- **Configuration**: `vite.config.js` with base path
- **Assets**: Bundled with CDN fallbacks
- **Deployment**: Automated via GitHub Actions

#### 2. Offline Channel (âœ… Complete)
- **Build Target**: Self-contained package with local servers
- **Configuration**: Modified build for relative paths
- **Assets**: All dependencies bundled locally
- **Servers**: Python, Node.js, batch, and shell scripts

#### 3. VS Code Extension (ðŸš« Removed)
- **Status**: Removed due to feature drift
- **Future**: Will be redesigned from scratch in a future phase
- **Reason**: Eliminated to maintain focus on core functionality

## Version Synchronization Strategy

### Semantic Versioning Implementation

**Format**: `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (e.g., 1.2.3)

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes in core functionality
- **MINOR**: New features, new distribution channels
- **PATCH**: Bug fixes, security updates, dependency updates

### Cross-Channel Version Management

1. **Single Version Source**: `package.json` version is authoritative
2. **Build-Time Injection**: Version injected into all builds
3. **Channel Tagging**: Git tags format `v1.2.3-web`, `v1.2.3-offline`
4. **Release Coordination**: All channels built from same commit

### Version Display Strategy

```typescript
// Version display in each channel
const VERSION_INFO = {
  core: "1.2.3",           // From package.json
  channel: "web",          // Injected at build time
  build: "20250703.1"      // Build timestamp
};
```

---

## Branch Strategy

### Development Workflow

```
main                      # Production-ready code, all channels
â”œâ”€â”€ develop              # Integration branch for new features
â”œâ”€â”€ feature/xxx          # Feature development branches
â”œâ”€â”€ release/v1.2.3       # Release preparation branches
â””â”€â”€ hotfix/xxx           # Critical bug fixes
```

### Channel Release Process âœ… AUTOMATED

1. **Feature Development**: `feature/xxx` â†’ `develop`
2. **Release Preparation**: `develop` â†’ `release/v1.2.3`
3. **Channel Testing**: Test all channels from release branch
4. **Production Release**: `release/v1.2.3` â†’ `main`
5. **ðŸš€ Automated Deployment**: GitHub Actions deploys to ALL channels

### Release Automation âœ… IMPLEMENTED

**GitHub Actions Workflow**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
```bash
# Triggers automatically on push to main
# - Runs tests and linting
# - Builds all channels
# - Deploys web app to GitHub Pages
# - Creates GitHub Release with offline package
# - Builds and pushes Docker image
# - Provides comprehensive deployment summary
```

## Cross-Platform Compatibility Validation

### Testing Matrix

| Platform | Web | Offline | Status |
|----------|-----|---------|--------|
| **Windows** | âœ… Chrome/Edge/Firefox | âœ… Python/Node.js | Ready |
| **macOS** | âœ… Safari/Chrome/Firefox | âœ… Python/Node.js | Ready |
| **Linux** | âœ… Chrome/Firefox | âœ… Python/Node.js | Ready |

### Compatibility Requirements

#### Web Channel
- **Browsers**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari 14+, Android Chrome 90+
- **Features**: ES2020 support, CSS Grid, WebGL (for Mermaid)

#### Offline Channel
- **Runtimes**: Python 3.7+, Node.js 14+
- **Systems**: Windows 10+, macOS 10.15+, Ubuntu 18.04+

## Distribution Documentation Strategy

### Channel-Specific Documentation

#### 1. Web Channel Documentation
- **Location**: `docs/WEB_DEPLOYMENT.md`

- **Migration Guide**: Moving between channels

---

## Security and Maintenance Strategy

### Security Audit Workflow

3. **Update Protocol**: Critical patches within 24 hours
4. **Channel Isolation**: Security issues contained per channel

### Maintenance Procedures
